# Phone Database Project
In this project, I have created a simple application to create, read, update and delete a database of phone numbers with user information attached to it

#### To Run this project, first clone the repository using 'git clone https://github.com/NanLieu/COM519' and then install the dependencies using
```
npm install
```

Next you will have to create a config.env file and place this in the phoneproject folder.

Inside the config.env file copy the following
```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:bz4ZAEIkdiTmMAwF@phoneproject.dvyfy.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
Finally, type in the below command to start the application
```
npm start
```
# COM519
